# Hackbio-GENOMICS-WORKSHOP
This contains tasks executed in an intense 5 weeks regimented genomics training organized by HackBio. I was assigned to team Newton and volunteered to be the team lead in order to be on my toes throughout the 5 weeks. The primary programming language used- Born Again Shell (BASh).

#Week 1(Stage 0) (PraiseStage0.sh)
Theme: Coding & Version Control

In this stage, I learnt how to use BASH to carry out basic and introductory tasks. After learning, my tasks included

1. Writing a simple Bash program with my first name and last name assigned to different variables and how to write the version where strings are printed on the same line and then different line.

2. Together with my team members, I completed a story in two notebooks provided by the HackBio team

#Week 2(Stage 1) (PraiseStage1.sh)
After learning the basics of how to use a programming language, I applied them to solve simple biological problems 

1. Count the number of sequences in a DNA file
2. Write a one-line command in bash to get the total A,T,G & C counts in the above sequence
3. Install three software
4. Downloads some sample datasets from here: https://github.com/josoga2/yt-dataset/tree/main/dataset
5. Create a folder called output
6. Implement the three software on the downloaded files (sample datasets) and send all outputs to the output folder.
